Don’t worry if you have not covered these at all yet, you will soon be using them in many courses and they will become completely familiar to you.

    "You will already know that there is no real solution to equations which involve the square roots of negative numbers. We can however express them in terms of imaginary number i where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$i=\\sqrt{-1}$\n",
    "A complex number, z, will then have a real part, a, and an imaginary part, bi, such that z=a+bi. Clearly, any imaginary number can be expressed as a point on a plane with the real component along one axis and the imaginary part along the other. The real axis is often denoted by the letter ℜ and the imaginary axis by the letter ℑ. Such a diagram is known as an Argand diagram after the amateur mathematician who first described imaginary numbers in this geometrical manner in 1806.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using series expansions it is easy to show that $e^{i\\theta}=\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta$ and so $z=re^{i\\theta}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Because $e^{ix}=\\cos x +i \\sin x$ it is also possible to define cos and sin for complex numbers as $\\cos x = \\frac{e^{ix}+e^{-ix}}{2}$ and $\\sin x =\\frac{e^{ix}-e^{-ix}}{2i}$. There are also ways of defining other operations such as the logarithm of a complex number, etc.\n"

    "### Universal functions \n",
    "NumPy provides a number of functions that operate on the elements of ndarrays. These are called universal functions (‘ufunc’s) Most ufuncs are implemented as compiled code and are consequently faster than applying the same operation on each element one-by-one using Python loops.\n",

    "Available ufuncs include math operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, exp, log, conjugate, sign, absolute, sqrt, ...,); trigonometric functions (cos, sin, tan, cosh, sinh, arccos, ...); comparison functions (greater, equal, less, ...). This is not a complete list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ufuncs may be called automatically when the infix operator notation is used with ndarrays. For example, writing a+b results in a call to add(a,b) if either a or b are ndarrays.\n",

    "Getting help on ufuncs\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the way ufuncs are implemented inside the library (which we will not go into here) using the standard Python help command, ‘help(conjugate)’ only gives generic information on ufuncs rather than on conjugate, which is probably not what you want.

    " NumPy provides a core of general purpose numerical functionality, and in particular for working with multi dimensional arrays. SciPy is much broader. It is built from a collection of various packages, or toolboxes, that are designed to perform more specialised tasks. Many of the SciPy packages themselves use NumPy as a base. These tools are wrapped together in such a way that they can all interoperate with each other (and with NumPy) making SciPy a very powerful suite of tools.\n",

    "<b>Note Because of the relationship of SciPy to NumPy, much of the NumPy functionality and names are also accessible directly from SciPy namespaces. The NumPy routines are imported directly into SciPy, so in most cases when you use the name in the SciPy namespace, you are actually using NumPy routine. There are exceptions, in particular for the linear algebra routines. SciPy has its own linear algebra routines which are more powerful and advanced than those provided by NumPy. In general, it is simplest to use use the SciPy namespace as this is generally the more optimised library where there are such differences.</b>"

Numerical optimisation is an interesting and complicated area. SciPy has an optimize module that contains a plethora of different methods. However, until you become an expert, we suggest that you only use some of the main functions. A basic minimization function in the current release is fmin.

    "## Numerical integration\n",
    "It is always very satisfying to be able to integrate a function analytically, however there many integrals that turn out to be very difficult and tedious to integrate analytically and many that are simply impossible. For these SciPy has a range of numerical integrators. You have probably heard of or even used the trapezium rule and Simpson’s rule for numerical integration. Both of these are available through SciPy, but the default is a function called quad which is part of the scipy.integrate set of functions. (If you want to know how it works do a web search for QUADPACK on which it is based.) The first calling argument is the function to be integrated and the second and third arguments are the limits of integration. What is returned is a tuple which has the value of the integration as its first element and an upper bound on the error as the second. Try the test example below:\n",

    "```\n",
    "You can of course supply your own function to integrate. If the function you want to integrate takes more than one argument, it is integrated along the axis of the first argument.
